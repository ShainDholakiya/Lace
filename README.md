Connection is the primary driver of human interaction. Lacee is simply a means for this basic need. Whether you need help with a project, homework, or anything else, Lacee is your solution. Post a bubble on Lacee and get "laceed up" with other members on your campus that have the skills required for what you need. On Lacee, you will be able to message, video chat, and get suggestions for nearby meet up locations to collaborate. You will also be able to conduct monetary transactions with each other over Lacee's secure payment system. During the sign up process, you will be asked to create a Lacee profile outlining your skills, classes taken, and any other information that can help verify your skillset for getting "laceed up" with other members.
